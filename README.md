## dotty-sandbox
Try to rewrite codes by [dotty](https://dotty.epfl.ch/) in the book "Functional Programming in Scala". But not fully. This is for my private project just learning new things of dotty. I'm planning to rewrite major things about FP (List, Option, Monoids, Monads, etc).

### Lists
- [x] List
- [x] Tree
- [x] Option
- [x] Par
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Monoid
- [ ] Functor, Applicative
- [x] Monad
- [ ] IO
- [ ] State
