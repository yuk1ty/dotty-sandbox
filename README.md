## dotty-sandbox
Try to rewrite codes by dotty in the book "Functional Programming in Scala". But not fully. This is for a private project just learning new things of dotty. I'm planning to rewrite major things about FP (List, Option, Monoids, Monads, etc).

### Lists
- [ ] List
- [ ] Tree
- [ ] Option
- [ ] Par
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Monoid
- [ ] Functor, Applicative
- [ ] Monad
- [ ] IO
- [ ] State
